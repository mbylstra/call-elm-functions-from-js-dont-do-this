    // Create an "Elm runtime"
    var elm = Elm.worker(Elm.PureElmExamples);

    // This runtime can now be used to "make" an Elm module, and expose it
    // for use from JS.
    var PureElmExamples = Elm.PureElmExamples.make(elm);
    // The PureElmExamples Elm module is now exposed as a javascript object,
    // with each function as a property of this object.

    // As you can see, using a function that takes a single string as an
    // argument is very straightforward. No conversion between Elm and JS
    // data structures is required.
    console.log(
      'PureElmExamples.stringReverse("hello world"):',
      PureElmExamples.stringReverse("hello world")
    );

    // Things start to get pretty weird when multiple arguments are required.
    // I think it has something to do with how currying is implemented in Elm, but don't ask me :)

    // You must deal with some very low level private code if you need
    // to convert between JS and Elm datastructures for which there is
    // not a one-to-one equivalence (as is the case with numbers and strings)


    // Here we expose some private functions that can be be used
    // to convert between the JS representation of an elm data structure
    // and a standard JS data structure.
    var _Utils = Elm.Native.Utils.make(elm);
    var _List = Elm.Native.List.make(elm);

    // In this example we convert from a JS array to an Elm list, and then
    // back again, so that we can use the listReverse Elm function.
    // _Utils.list() is used to convert from a JS array to an Elm list.
    // _List.toArray() is used to convert from an Elm list to a JS array.
    console.log(
      '_List.toArray(PureElmExamples.listReverse(_Utils.list([1,2,3]))): ',
      _List.toArray(
        PureElmExamples.listReverse(
          _Utils.list([1,2,3])
        )
      )
    );

    // WARNING:
    // Doing this kind of thing is very much discouraged as these internal APIs will
    // most likely change. There may one day be an official way of of doing this.
    // You would need a really good reason to use this kind of thing. You
    // should use Ports instead.
